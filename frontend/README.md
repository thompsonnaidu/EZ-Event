# EZ EVENT
EZEvent is an event booking application designed to allow users to create, register for, and cancel event bookings. This mini-project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies, including React for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The application utilizes **GraphQL** to manage data interactions, providing a practical example of how to implement and leverage **GraphQL** in a real-world application. The primary goal of EZEvent is to offer hands-on experience with **GraphQL** and build a fully functional event management system.
